# About me

- Currently an assistant professor of Urban Studies and Planning at Portland State University
- Never had formal computer science training/background
- Did dissertation research on urban simulation models (with Paul Waddell)
- Worked as a developer for UrbanSim for a number of years
- Research interests on land use - transportation interaction (LUTI) models

# Two Case Studies

- Imputation of missing data for travel surveys
- Predictive models of travel behavior

# Case I: Imputation of Missing Data 

National Household Travel Survey (NHTS), 2001
<!-- missingness -->

# Case II: Travel Behavior Modeling

$$\text{VMT}_h \sim f(\text{SES}_h, \text{regional characteristics}, \text{built environment})$$
Data Sources:

- 2009 NHTS for household's SES, travel outcome (VMT);
- EPA's Smart Location Database (for blockgroup level 5D built environment measures);
- Highway Performance Measure System for regionwide roadway information;
- National Transit Database for regionwide transit supply.

150,000 households with more than 200 independent variables (before considering non-linear transformation or interaction between variables)

# VMT models

- Statistical Models
   - linear regression
   - non-linear regression (transformed dependent variable)
   - tobit model
   - hurdle model
   - two step model
- Machine learning algorithms
   - Random Forest
   - Gradient Tree Boosting
   - Deep nureal network
